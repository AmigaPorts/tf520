Terrible Fire 68020 "Accelerator"
=================================

** I AM NO LONGER WORKING ON THIS. REQUESTS FOR SUPPORT WILL BE IGNORED.

This repository contains all the files needed to produce a copy of my accelerator board.

The CPLD Required is a XC9532XL-VQ44

Firmware / Requirements
------------

  * Xilinx ISE, 14.7 (the final version - other versions may work but this is the one I support)
  * JTAG Adaptor

PCB Manufacture
---------------

To populate a PCB you will likely need the following tools.

  * Soldering Station (with hot air rework and an iron - probably with a few tips)
  * Stereo Microscope (or similar for soldering under)
  * Bench Power Supply (to verify the regulator circuit)
 
There will be those with more experience and great eyesight that could manage it with just a soldering iron but I am trying to be realistic here.
